# 🧠 Turkish Legal NLP Model

This repository contains a custom-trained Transformer-based Question Answering (QA) system built for Turkish legal texts. The system is capable of training on a custom tokenizer and dataset, and post-processing predictions using a large language model (LLaMA 3 via Groq API) and translation to provide clearer Turkish responses.

## Model Architecture

### 📁 Files Overview
model_training.py

This script handles training a Transformer-based QA model using PyTorch.
🔍 Key Components:

- TransformerQA: A lightweight Transformer encoder with learned positional embeddings and a final classification head for start and end token prediction.

- QADataset: A PyTorch Dataset that prepares question-context-answer triples using a PreTrainedTokenizerFast tokenizer.

- Tokenizer: Loaded from a local JSON file (trained_tokenizer.json) and padded if necessary.

- Training Loop: Implements loss computation with CrossEntropyLoss, optimizer with Adam, and early stopping based on validation loss.

- Evaluation: F1 score computation is used as a secondary metric.

- Model Saving: Best-performing model is saved to transformer_qa_model.pth.

post_processing_model.py

This script loads the trained model and performs prediction, followed by response refinement using a LLaMA-3 model and translation into Turkish.
🔍 Key Components:

- Model Inference: Predicts answer spans for given questions using the same TransformerQA architecture.

- Context Retrieval: Chooses appropriate context from: Dataset (turkish_QA_law_dataset.json), or Fallback files (kanun_is.txt, kanun_ceza.txt) based on question content.

- LLM Integration: Uses Groq's LLaMA 3 API to rephrase raw predictions.

- Translation: Uses deep_translator to convert the refined English output back into Turkish.

### 🚀 How to Use
1. Train the model:

python model_training.py

2. Generate an answer for a question:

python post_processing_model.py

### ⚙️ Requirements

Install dependencies:

    pip install torch transformers groq deep-translator

### 🔐 API Key

The Groq API key is hardcoded in the script for demo purposes. For production, I recommend you to store it securely using environment variables or .env files.

You can get it free from here (https://console.groq.com/home)

### 📌 Notes

This model performs best on questions found in the training dataset.

Post-processing with LLaMA3 improves clarity and coherence.

Predictions are presented in fluent Turkish through automatic translation.

## 🗂️ Data Management

The dataset have aproximatly 600 cases and 6000 different QAs. This section explains how the dataset have been created.

### 📥 Data Collection  
Data have been collected from "Yargıtay Emsal Karar" using web scraping techniques.

### 🧹 Data Pre-processing  
1. Legal case texts were cleaned, summarized, and structured to serve as context in dataset.  
2. Question-answer pairs were generated using the OpenAI API based on the prepared context.  
3. Using the Noisy Channel Model, we identified answer spans within the context and labeled the data for supervised training of Transformer-based NLP models.

### 📄 Creating the Dataset  
The dataset was created in JSON format for better structure and easier integration with NLP training pipelines.
